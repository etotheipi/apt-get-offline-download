Debian/Ubuntu Offline Package Downloader

The simply python script can be used with any Linux distro that uses apt-get
for package management.  You provide it a list of packages to download, and 
it will use its package manager to collect download links and MD5 sums of the 
package *and its dependency tree*.  It will cram all these into python script
that could be run on any system with a standard python installation.  It will
also attempt to run this script, though failure is expected if this is an 
offline system.

Put the downloaded *.deb files onto a USB key or some other removable media,
and take them to the offline computer.  "cd" into the directory and run 
"sudo dpkg -i *.deb".  This will install all debs in the directory.  Since
you downloaded the dependency trees, every dependency of any one of the debs
is also in the dir, unless it's in the default OS installation.

NOTE:  If the package or any of its dependencies are already installed, then 
it will return less than would be needed for a bare installation.  If you are
working with an offline computer, it is recommended you either run the script
on the target offline system, or run it on an online computer/VM that is a 
completely fresh install of the target OS.  Otherwise it won't fetch the 
entire dependency tree.
