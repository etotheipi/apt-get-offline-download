Debian/Ubuntu Offline Package Downloader

The simply python script can be used with any Linux distro that uses apt-get
for package management.  You provide it a location to dump the packages, and
then a list of packages you want.  It will use its package manager to collect
download links and MD5 sums of the package *and its dependency tree*.  

If this is run from an offline computer, it will simply write a script with
all the wget commands to fetch the dependencies.  It can then be run from 
any online Linux system to fetch all the .debs and put them in a directory.  
Take that dir back to the offline computer and simply run "sudo dpkg -i *.deb".

NOTE:  If the package or any of its dependencies are already installed, then 
it will return less than would be needed for a bare installation.  If you are
working with an offline computer, it is recommended you either run the script
on an offline computer, or run it on an online computer that is a completely
fresh install of the OS.  Otherwise it won't fetch the entire dependency tree.
